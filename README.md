# Comprehensive Brain Tumor Classification System with Slicer and Machine Learning 

## Purpose 
The project aims to support the segmentation and classification process of brain tumors.

## Installation
First, download the 3D Slicer from here. Select the version that corresponds to your operating system.

1. Download and unzip this repository.
2. Slicer menu: Edit > Application Settings > Developer
3. Modules > Developer Tools > Extension Wizard
4. Select Extension (choose the folder where you unzipped the repo)

Steps 2-4 are visualized on [Developing Slicer Extensions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JXIfs0rAM7DwZAho57Jqz14MRn2BIMrjB17Uj_7Yztc/edit#slide=id.g420896289_061) slides 8 to 10.
